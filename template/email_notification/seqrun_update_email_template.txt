Dear {{ customerName }}, {% if not send_email_to_user %}EMAIL FOR {{ customerEmail }}{% endif %}

We would like to update you that the fastq files from a recent sequencing run "{{ flowcellId }} - {{ projectRunDate }}" is now available for your project {{ projectName }}.

DATA ACCESS (via Globus, FILES AVAILABLE FOR 30 DAYS):
  - Help page (by Imperial's RCS team):
    - https://icl-rcs-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rds/transferringdata/globus/

  - For FIRST run of any project

PRIMARY ANALYSES:
  Let us know if you or your bioinformatic team needs any help with the primary analyses for your project (e.g., alignment and gene count for RNA-Seq and Cellranger count metrics for 10X gene expression library). Now we support running a number of community developed (e.g., NF-core pipelines) or vendor provided (e.g., Cellranger from 10X Genomics) analyses pipelines for our users. A list of supported pipelines can be found here:
