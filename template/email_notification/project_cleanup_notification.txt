Dear {{ user_name }}, {% if not send_email_to_user %}EMAIL FOR {{ user_email }}{% endif %}
<p/>
We would like to inform you that we are preparing to remove data for the following old project(s) from our servers.
<p/>
<ul>{% for project_name in projectLists %}
<li> {{ project_name }} </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p/>
It would be great if you could check and confirm by <span style='color:red'><b>{{ deletionDate }}</b></span>, if you need data backup for any of these project(s). Otherwise, we will <span style='color:red'><b>REMOVE</b></span> the raw and analysis data for them after this deadline.
<p/>
Please follow the instructions for data transfer on our help docs:
https://imperial-genomics-facility.github.io/igf-pipeline-help/data_access.html
<p/>
You need to confirm this before <span style='color:red'><b>{{ deletionDate }}</b></span>.
<p/>
Kind regards<p/>Imperial BRC Genomics Facility
