# Data Management Using Python Library

https://data-management-python.readthedocs.io

This repository contains the core Python library developed and maintained by the NIHR Imperial BRC Genomics Facility for managing raw and processed genomic datasets efficiently.

## Key Features

**1. Metadata Management**
  * Utilizes an extended [ENA metadata model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html) for managing information about:
    * Projects
    * Samples
    * Sequencing runs
    * Analysis
    * File paths and
    * Pipeline instances

**2. Genomic Sequencing Runs Processing**
  * Tracks ongoing sequencing runs and initiates processing upon completion.
  * Generates summary reports and sends email notifications to users.

**3. Analysis Pipelines**
  * Includes wrappers for both community-developed and vendor-provided data pipelines.
  * Automates:
    * Configuration generation
    * Input formatting
  * Executes external pipelines on HPC using bash script wrappers.
  * Manages post-processing, including:
    * Custom report generation
    * Analysis data validation

## Requirements
â€¢	Python v3.9

## Installation
**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imperial-genomics-facility/data-management-python.git
```

**2. Install Dependencies**
Install required Python libraries:
